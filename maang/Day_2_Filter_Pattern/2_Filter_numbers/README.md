## Filter Pattern

# Filter numbers greater than 5

A teacher is reviewing test scores: 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, and 9. To identify high-performing students, she wants to only list the scores greater than 5. Write a program to filter the scores that only meet this criterion. 
**Guide**: Check if each number is greater than 5 and include it in the output list. 
**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(k) space where k is number of valid results.
