# Calculate Shopping Cart Total With Tax

At a grocery store, Lisa's shopping cart contains an apple priced at $1.50 and a banana at $0.75. The local sales tax is 8%. To finalize her purchase, Lisa needs to calculate the total cost including tax. Write a program to compute the subtotal of the items and apply 8% to get the final amount. 
Guide: Accumulate the subtotal of item prices, then multiply by (1 + tax rate) to include tax.
