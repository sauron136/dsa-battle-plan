## Two Pointer Tecnique

# Merge Two Sorted Lists

A librarian is combining two sorted lists of book IDs: [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6]. To create a single sorted catalog, write a program to merge the lists in order. 

**Guide:** Compare elements from both lists, adding the smaller one to the result. 

**Complexity:** O(n + m) time, O(n + m) space.
