## Two Pointer Technique

# Check If a String is Palindrome

A word game app needs to verify if the word "racecar" is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) to award points. Write a program to check if the word is a palindrome. 

**Guide:** Use two pointers (start and end) to compare characters, moving inward. 

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space.
