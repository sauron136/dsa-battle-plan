# Convert Strings To Uppercase

A school is printing name tags for students, with names like 'hello' and 'world'. To make them stand out, all names need to be in uppercase. Write a program to convert each name to uppercase.

**Guide:** Apply the '.upper()' function to each string in the list.

**Complexity:** O(n*m) where n is number of strings, m is average string length.
