## Accumulator Patterns: Beginner Problems

# Sum Only Positive Numbers From Mixed List

A store manager is reviewing daily sales, where some transactions resulted in refunds (negative amounts). The transactions are $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5. To calculate the total revenue from successful sales, the manager needs to sum only the positive transaction amounts. Write a program to find the total of positive numbers in the list.
Guide: Start with a total of 0 and add each number only if it is positive.
