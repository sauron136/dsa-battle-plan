# Count Total characters in a List of Words

A teacher is preparing a vocabulary quiz and has a list of words: "hello", "world" and "python". To ensure the quiz fits on a single page, she needs to know the total number of letters in all the words combined (exclduing spaces). Write a program to calculate the total numer of characters in the given list of words. 
Guide: start with a count of 0 and add the length of each word to the total.
