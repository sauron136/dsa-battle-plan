## Filter Pattern

# Filter Words Longer Than Four Characters

A librarian is selecting book titles for a display, with titles including "cat", "elephant", "dog" and "butterfly". To ensure readability, she wants only titles longer than 4 characters. Write a program to filter the list of titles accordingly. 
**Guide:** Check if the length of each word is greater than 4 and include it in the output.
**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(k) space
