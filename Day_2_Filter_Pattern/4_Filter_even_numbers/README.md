## Filter Pattern

# Filter Even Numbers

A maths tutor is preparing a lesson on even numbers and has a list of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. To create practice problems, they need to filter out only the even numbers. Write a program to select the even numbers from the list.
**Guide:** Check if each number is divisible by 2 (number % 2 == 0) and include it.
**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(k) space
