# Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear collections where each node points to the next, allowing O(1) insertion/deletion but O(n) access. In Python, implement with classes. Good for dynamic size, frequent insertions.

## Key Operations
- **Traversal**: Following pointers to visit nodes. Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
- **Insertion**: Adding nodes by updating pointers. Time: O(1) if position known, O(n) search; Space: O(1).
- **Deletion**: Removing nodes by updating pointers. Time: O(1) if position known, O(n) search; Space: O(1).
- **Reversal**: Reversing links. Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
- **Merging**: Combining lists. Time: O(n + m), Space: O(1).
