# Hash Map (Dictionary in Python)

Hash maps are key-value pairs with average O(1) lookup, insertion, and deletion via hashing. In Python, dict is a hash map. Useful for frequency counting, mappings, caching. Worst-case O(n) due to collisions, but average O(1).

## Key Operations
- **Insertion**: Adding key-value pairs. Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Lookup/Search**: Retrieving value by key. Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Deletion**: Removing keys. Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Iteration/Counting**: Traversing entries or counting frequencies. Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
- **Grouping/Mapping**: Grouping by key or mapping values. Time: O(n), Space: O(n).
