# Sets

Sets are collections of unique elements with O(1) average lookup, insertion, deletion. In Python, set is hash-based. Useful for uniqueness, membership testing, intersections. Worst-case O(n), average O(1).

## Key Operations
- **Insertion**: Adding elements (ignores duplicates). Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Lookup/Membership**: Checking if element exists. Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Deletion**: Removing elements. Time: O(1) average, Space: O(1).
- **Union/Intersection/Difference**: Combining sets. Time: O(n + m), Space: O(n + m).
- **Iteration/Counting Uniques**: Traversing or counting unique items. Time: O(n), Space: O(1).
